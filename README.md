# Final-Project-final-draft-
The goal of this program is to tell the user how many miles they have until a certain service/maintenance is due. 
The program will take the amount of miles each service/maitenance has to be done at and the user's vehicle mileage, 
then return the amount of miles until each service/maintenance is due.
